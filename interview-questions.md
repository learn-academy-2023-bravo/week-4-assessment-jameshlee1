# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: is an open computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby? 

Your answer: an integer is a whole number as to a float is a number with a decimal. an example of an integer is 10 as to a flow is 10.35

Researched answer: Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Ruby is a function that returns a value without a return keyword. example is class = Animal end

Researched answer: In Ruby, we can take advantage of implicit return. The implicit return of a Ruby method is the final statement inside the method. In other words, the method will return the result of the final line before the end keyword.

1. What is a block in Ruby? 

Your answer: a block is a container in ruby that consists of code.

Researched answer: A block looks similar to a method in Ruby. Methods consist of a name, but with blocks we don't need to write a name, and always pass to a method call. Blocks are a handy and powerful feature in Ruby, and we can use them anywhere. Blocks are anonymous pieces of code that accept input from arguments and return a value

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: by using the bracket notation.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a hash is a collection of key-value pairs.
A hash is denoted by a set of curly braces ({}) which contains key-value pairs separated by commas. Each value is assigned to a key using a hash rocket (=>). Calling the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs the value associated with that key.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: RSpec is a computer domain-specific language testing tool written in the programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development framework which is extensively used in production applications.

2. Test-driven development: Test Driven Development is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

3. PostgreSQL: is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance

4. CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete

5. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.
